# Next Sentence Prediction using Generative AI

## Project Overview

The **Next Sentence Prediction using Generative AI** project aims to build a system that predicts the next sentence based on a user-provided input. It leverages transformer-based models, specifically GPT-2, to generate coherent and contextually appropriate next sentences. The system is integrated with a user-friendly **Streamlit** interface for real-time interaction, making it suitable for applications in chatbots, content generation, smart editors, and summarization tools.

### Key Features:
- Accepts a user-provided sentence or paragraph.
- Generates one or more contextually relevant next sentences using GPT-2.
- Filters and ranks suggestions based on coherence and fluency.
- Easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit.
